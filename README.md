## Node Express Starter 

This mini-project puts the skills learned from two courses into practice:

 - Learn Node (Wes Bos)  
 - Building a Javascript Development Environment (Cory House/ Pluralsight)

 The goal was to develop an understanding of how Express apps are constructed and the purpose of each individual package. It also avoids having to resolve large numbers of security vulnerabilities by using up to date versions of each package.
   
This repository is intended as a starter to get future Node/Express projects set up quickly.

It features:

 - ES-Lint
 - npm scripts
 - nodemon for automatic server restart
 - Basic demo app based on a Model-View-Controller pattern
 - MongoDB
 - Pug 

Repository doesn't include the connection string to the Mongo database.

Future plans for this repository include Webpack integration and more advance error handling.
